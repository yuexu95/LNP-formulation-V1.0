    ### Key features
    - **N/P ratio metrics** for quick quality checks.
    - **Bulk volumes**: auto-summed master mixes (ethanol ×1.5, aqueous ×1.2) and totals for multi-batch prep.
    - **History & export**: each run saved; download CSV for record-keeping.

    ### Quick start
    1. Run locally: `streamlit run 👋Homepage.py`
    2. Open a calculator page, enter parameters, and click **Calculate**.
    3. Expand **Bulk View details** in History to see multi-batch volumes.

    ### Enjoy the app!
